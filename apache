1. Configure / Setup Apache
# First, clean-up yum:
$ sudo yum clean all
# As a matter of best practice weâ€™ll update our packages:
$ sudo yum -y update
# Installing Apache is as simple as running just one command:
$ sudo yum -y install httpd


2. Install / Start Apache
# Allow the default HTTP and HTTPS port, ports 80 and 443, through firewalld:

$ sudo firewall-cmd --permanent --add-port=80/tcp

$ sudo firewall-cmd --permanent --add-port=443/tcp

# And reload the firewall:

$ sudo firewall-cmd --reload
# Start Apache
$ systemctl start httpd

3. Configure Apache to serve web content from all home directories
# I am also hosting multile sites from /var/www/html/site*
# Site 1 and Site 2 are both hosting web content, the files are located in /var/www/html site1 site 2 folders

I think I have done it correctly now
inside the /etc/httpd/conf.d you have to edit the userdir.conf
  # To enable requests to /~user/ to serve the user's public_html
  # directory, remove the "UserDir disabled" line above, and uncomment
  # the following line instead:
  #UserDir public_html

4. Create "Hello World" page for 2 users
# Create the index.html file in 
$ /var/www/html/

5. Startup Apache at boot  
$ sudo systemctl enable httpd

6. Configure Apache to run on port 8080
  In the /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf change the Listen directive to 8080
  Listen 8080


7. Run Apache not as root, but as a different user.
  # User/Group: The name (or #number) of the user/group to run httpd as.
  # It is usually good practice to create a dedicated user and group for
  # running httpd, as with most system services.

  User rome
  Group rome

8. Start the HTTPD parent process as another user (not root) on port 80
  Instructions @ Link you will also have to change the permission on the HTTPD logs or move the logs. I moved 
  mine to the /tmp/access_error location.
