# Requirements
1. Configure/Setup Apache
2. Install/Start Apache
3. Configure Apache to serve web content from all home directories
4. Create "Hello World" page for 2 users
5. Startup Apache at boot
6. Configure Apache to run on port 8080
7. Run Apache not as root, but as a different user.
8. Start the HTTPD parent process as another user (not root) on port 80


Step 1: Install Apache
First, clean-up yum:

sudo yum clean all

As a matter of best practice weâ€™ll update our packages:

sudo yum -y update

Installing Apache is as simple as running just one command:

sudo yum -y install httpd


Step 2: Allow Apache Through the Firewall
Allow the default HTTP and HTTPS port, ports 80 and 443, through firewalld:

sudo firewall-cmd --permanent --add-port=80/tcp

sudo firewall-cmd --permanent --add-port=443/tcp

And reload the firewall:

sudo firewall-cmd --reload

Step 3: Configure Apache to Start on Boot
And then start Apache:

sudo systemctl start httpd

Be sure that Apache starts at boot:

sudo systemctl enable httpd

To check the status of Apache:

sudo systemctl status httpd

To stop Apache:

sudo systemctl stop httpd

# I am also hosting multile sites from /var/www/html/site*
#Site 1 and Site 2 are both hosting web content, the files are located in /var/www/html site1 site 2 folders

#4 Updates on #4, I think I have done it correctly now
  inside the /etc/httpd/conf.d you have to edit the userdir.conf
    # To enable requests to /~user/ to serve the user's public_html
    # directory, remove the "UserDir disabled" line above, and uncomment
    # the following line instead:
    #UserDir public_html
