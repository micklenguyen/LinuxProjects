1. Install / Enable SSL
  # openssl is already baked into the OS of Centos
 
  # Install Mod SSL, mod_ssl, is an Apache module that provides support for SSL encryption
  $ sudo yum install mod_ssl
  
2. Enable SSL with a passphrase

Drop the -nodes flag
-nodes: This tells OpenSSL to skip the option to secure our certificate with a passphrase. We need Apache to be able to read the file, without user intervention, when the server starts up. A passphrase would prevent this from happening, since we would have to enter it after every restart.

# First, we need to create a new directory where we will store the server key and certificate:
$ sudo mkdir /etc/httpd/ssl


# We can create the SSL key and certificate files with openssl:

$ sudo openssl req -x509 -nodes -days 365 -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout /etc/httpd/ssl/apache.key -out /etc/httpd/ssl/apache.crt



3. Disable the RC4 ciphers
  # This will show you which ciphers are being used by your server
  $ openssl ciphers -V
  # You have to look in the SSLCipherSuite section of the ssl.conf file and add !RC4
  $ /etc/httpd/conf.d/ssl.conf

  
  4. Find a command line utility that will enable you from your minion to connect to your master to verify the ciphers that you have disabled have actually been disabled 
      # This is the closest I got to testing if the RC4 ciphers were disabled
      $ nmap --script ssl-cert,ssl-enum-ciphers -p 443 127.0.0.1 | grep RC4

5. Create a certificate in D.E.R format and try to make it work. Then convert the certificate back to PEM



6. Make it so the client browser trusts the certificate of the server
