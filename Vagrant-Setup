lsof -i -n -P



Good Read on lsof 
http://www.thegeekstuff.com/2012/08/lsof-command-examples/

list open files, list of all open files and the processes that opened them. Since everything on Linux is considered a file the -i  option will list all network connections. 

-i 
selects the listing of files any of whose Internet address matches the address specified in i.  If no address is specified, this option selects the listing of all Internet and  x.25  (HP-UX)
                network files.


-n 
inhibits  the  conversion of network numbers to host names for network files.  Inhibiting con‐
                version may make lsof run faster.  It is also useful when host  name  lookup  is  not  working
                properly.


-P
inhibits  the conversion of port numbers to port names for network files.  Inhibiting the con‐
                version may make lsof run a little faster.  It is also useful when port  name  lookup  is  not
                working properly.


Shows Firewall Rules 
Good to use when troubleshooting issues connection to your master. this will show if any rules are in place to block  that connection 

iptables -L -v -n
